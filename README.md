- 👋 Hi, I’m @miawestermann
- 👀 I’m interested in herbalism, hiking, camping, and creating art out of bones. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of code, project management, and fostering community with developers using InnerSource methodology. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything and everything! There is no limit for learning and teaching.
